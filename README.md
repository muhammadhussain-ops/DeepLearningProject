This is the file for the final exam project in Deep learning (02450).

Learning Dynamics of Ultra-Low Temperature Freezer for both normal operation
and especially fault detection/ abnormal events is of key interest to ensuring reliable
operation and reducing operating cost (energy use). The goal is to improve operations
reezers and detect faults before they occur. The data consists of high-resolution
historical data (spanning 10 years) and label regular events and fault events.

Supervised by Wiebke Meesenburg, DTU Construct (wmeese@dtu.dk), and Jesper LÃ¸ve Hinrich, DTU Compute (jehi@dtu.dk).

OBS: the data that is used in the computations isnt in this repository and should be downloaded by the dataset (due to storage limitations).
