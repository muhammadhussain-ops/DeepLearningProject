Learning Dynamics of Ultra-Low Temperature Freezer for both normal operation
and especially fault detection/ abnormal events is of key interest to ensuring reliable
operation and reducing operating cost (energy use). The goal is to improve operations
reezers and detect faults before they occur. The data consists of high-resolution
historical data (spanning 10 years) and label regular events and fault events.
